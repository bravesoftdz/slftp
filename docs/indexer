slFtp is capable to auto fill requests from v1.2.0.15.
slFtp maintanes an SQLite database with release names and locations (sites and 
pathes), this is the source what it can reqfill from, this is called index.
To add stuffs to the index, you need to add autoindex tasks. For example:
!setdir HQ MP3ARCHIVE /ARCHIVES/MP3
!autoindex HQ 86400 MP3ARCHIVE
These two commands above make slftp to index HQ's MP3ARCHIVE section every day.
The depth of the section is discovered dynamically: the first nfo will 
determine where the rips are stored. For eg.:
/ARCHIVES/MP3 has stuffs the following way:
/ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01/Foobar-Foobar1-2009-SHIT
/ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/02/Foobar-Foobar2-2009-SHIT
slFtp will dirlist /ARCHIVES/MP3 first, then /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009 then
/ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01 then /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01 then 
/ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01/Foobar-Foobar1-2009-SHIT, it finds the nfo there,
so it treats /ARCHIVES/MP3/2009/01/01/ as a container dir and adds
Foobar-Foobar2-2009-SHIT into the index.

Then you need to setup REQUEST section on sites where you want the bot to fill 
requests on. This is done with the autodirlist feature, since REQUEST sections
are handled specially. For example:
!setdir DUMP REQUEST /requests
!autodirlist DUMP 900 REQUEST
These two commands above make slftp to look for new requests on DUMP every 15 
mins.

slFtp (atm) parses dirnames in REQUEST section with the following restrictions:
- request dir must start with prefix REQ-
- the request itself might contain a timestamp prefix in 10 characters format

For eg. a valid directory is:
REQ-2005-01-13_Foobar-Foobar-2009-SHIT

Then slFtp will query the index for Foobar-Foobar-2009-SHIT. If its found, 
it will send to the site where its requested, IF a direct route (!help setspeed)
exists between a source and the requester site.
If a rip is found in more than one sources, all of them will be utilized.

If a rip is present on the requester site, then a new dir will be created
in the request's directory showing where it can be found and the request will be
reqfilled.

Note: SQLite database is in plain text. If you dont like this, use some file 
system encryption. See also the [indexer] section of slftp.ini
Or you can donate a licence to any of the following SQLite extensions:
http://www.sqlite-crypt.com
http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/prosupport.html
http://www.sqlcrypt.com/

Note: On Linux you need to install libsqlite3. Check very first lines of slftp.log 
if it could load the lib succesfully. Feature becomes disabled if it failed.
On Windows sqlite3.dll is included.
