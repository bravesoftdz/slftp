Usage: <cmd> [sitename] section releasename
Description: Executes the background lookup task attached to the TRelease descendent.
In human words: 
- if its an mp3 release, genre lookup will be performed by dirlisting.
- if its an mdvdr/mv rip, nfo will be fetched and parsed for genre
- if its a tv release, tvrage lookup will be done
- if its a movie release => imdb

Note: these lookups are done in the background automaticly without the need for 
issuing this command manually. Use this command only if you need to (for eg
there was a site error while fetching the nfo so the bot couldnt get the genre
for a mdvdr rip)
