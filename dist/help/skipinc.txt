Usage: <cmd> sitename [value]
Value can be 0 or 1. Leave it blank to display current value.
You can use * as sitename to list/set all sites skipinc values.

When the site is used as a source site in a transfer, setting this to 1 will prevent
slftp from transfering a file that is still being uploaded on that source site.
This can prevent your transfers from being stuck on slow/incomplete files and eating
credits for nothing.

If not set it will read global value skip_being_uploaded_files from slftp.ini.

It actually works only with for GLFTPD sites. This has no effect (yet) on other FTPD softwares.
