Adds a rule for precatcher. Channel must already be configured. See <prefix>ircchanadd
Usage: <cmd> sitename netname channelname botnicks (PRE|NEWDIR) words [section]
botnicks is a comma separated list of nicks of the bot.
Event can be NEWDIR and PRE.
Words is a comma seperated list of words which are present in the actual announce line.
Section is optional, you can use it to force the section (if the announce line doesnt contain it)

You probably want to add (at least) three catch rules for each of your sites.
Ok, we have a site called X3, they are very expert guys and customized the theme, 
so they announce pre as squirt and newdir is fisting, 1st file is anal,
race event is gangbang.
Lets add its rules:
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot PRE squirt
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NEWDIR fisting
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NEWDIR gangbang
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot NEWDIR anal

Note: for iso sites its better if you add rules for events like race, 50% complete etc,
so the bot would know, the race is still in progress or its being continued (after someone
left it incomplete). Simple add several rules for them as NEWDIR.
